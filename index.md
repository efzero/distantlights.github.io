I am an Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://www.umich.edu/). Previously I worked at Microsoft as an applied scientist.

I obtained my Master's degree in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. Lei Xing; Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from [University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). 

My research interests lie in applications and theories of generative models and diffusion models. Recently, my projects focus on efficient training and inference on high-dimensional data with diffusion models. My previous projects are also related to test-time adaptation and implicit neural representation learnings.





In this blog, we will explore interesting stuff here. Topics including: thoughts on technology development and societal impacts, reflection on methodological approach to problem solving, training for physical fitness, recovering from injury, classical music analysis and so on.
